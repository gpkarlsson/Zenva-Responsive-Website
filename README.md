## Description

This webpage was made as an example of a company website. Since we do not know what device this website will be viewed on, it is important to use responsive design, so that the website will adapt in accordance with how it is being viewed and used. This website adapts between a horizontal layout in a wider window, and a vertical layout in narrower windows.
